**ESX/QB/ND Supported**

A submarine heist that allows you to breach a submarine and combat your way through dozens of guards to get the reward.

**Features**:

* Camera movement motion and alarm sound intergration to increase the intensity of the task.
* A integrated timer system to spice things up and make it competitive in your server. This works well for small pop servers to pass time or for those players with huge arena egos.
* A leaderboard that updates and displays the TOP 5 fastest submarine heist completionists in order with time and character name.
* Death and crash/quit handling built in.
* Blacklisted guns to prevent players from taking overpowered weapons.
* Utilizes player buckets so people can do sub heists at the same time but in different worlds.
* Individual character cooldowns, rather than global.
* Pre-configured ped spawns and rewards but you must have the basic knowledge to change these yourself as I will not help you.
* Use your own minigame for the hack (read the code to see comments on how to change). It will use ps-ui as a default.
